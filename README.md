In this personal project, my objective is to increase my knowledge in finance. To achieve this, I will focus on various aspects of financial analysis and explore different techniques and tools. 

By exploring these areas of interest, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of financial analysis, improve my decision-making skills in investment strategies, and enhance my overall knowledge in finance.

(Currently, the stock.py file contains a few implementations as it is a personal project that I work on during my free time to improve my skills in finance and Python the idea is to find certifiactions | courses to get preapre and find a position to get real and production experience).
Some of the areas of interest include:

Correlation Analysis: I will analyze the correlation between different stocks to understand the relationship between their price movements. This analysis will help me identify diversification opportunities and assess portfolio risk.

Volatility Analysis: I will calculate the volatility of stock prices using metrics such as standard deviation, average true range (ATR), or Bollinger Bands. Volatility analysis will provide insights into the potential risk and price fluctuations associated with the stocks.

Financial Ratios: I will use the stock data to calculate financial ratios such as the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), earnings per share (EPS), and dividend yield. These ratios will provide insights into the valuation and financial health of the companies.

Candlestick Chart Analysis: I will visualize the stock data using candlestick charts, which display the open, high, low, and close prices for each day. Candlestick patterns can provide insights into price trends, market sentiment, and potential reversal points.

Moving Averages: I will calculate and plot moving averages of different time periods to identify trends and potential support/resistance levels. Moving averages smooth out price fluctuations and can help in determining entry and exit points.

Volume Analysis: I will analyze the trading volume associated with the stock data to understand the level of market interest and liquidity. Volume analysis can provide insights into price movements and potential market trends.

Risk Analysis: I will calculate risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) or drawdowns to assess the potential downside risk associated with the stocks. Risk analysis will help in portfolio optimization and risk management.

Time Series Forecasting: I will utilize time series forecasting techniques, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or machine learning algorithms, to predict future stock prices based on historical data. Forecasting can assist in making investment decisions and managing portfolios.

Historical Price Analysis: I will analyze the historical price data to identify trends, patterns, and fluctuations in the stock prices over time. I will calculate metrics such as moving averages, standard deviation, and rate of return to assess the volatility and stability of the stocks.

Performance Comparison: I will compare the performance of different stocks or the same stock over different time periods. I will calculate metrics like cumulative return, annualized return, and relative performance to evaluate the performance of stocks relative to benchmarks or other stocks.
